# gym-minigrid-implementation
Training an agent using RL tabular methods on gym-minigrid
The agent has been trained using 3 algoriths:
  1. Sarsa0
  2. Sarsa Lambda
  3. Q-Learning
The agent was trained on 4 environments:
  1. 5x5 Empty room
  2. 6x6 Empty room
  3. 8x8 Empty room
  4. Four Rooms
  
Resuts:
Graphs between episode and rewards and episode and steps were plotted.
